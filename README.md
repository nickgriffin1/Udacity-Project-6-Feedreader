###About
The final project, Project 6, of my Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. This project is meant to introduce students to unit testing using Jasmine.

###Instructions
* Visit http://nickgriffin1.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader
* Upon load, Jasmine should appear in a bar at the bottom. The spec bar should be green, meaning that all the tests have passed. If a spec does not pass, Jamsmine will inform the user which spec does not pass.
* Optional: click the menu button in the top left corner and select a new feed to view the application.
